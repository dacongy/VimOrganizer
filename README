I've been working on a clone of Emacs' Org-mode and wanted to announce
an early version of it that's available (for the adventurous) at
Github:
https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer

******************************************************************************************
IMPORTANT:  This is not yet  a polished plugin that you can just install and use!  It's a big project in a very early state, in a constant state of major change, with lots of work left to be done.  A lot of it works, and works well, but there are plenty of bugs and it's not yet a plugin that "plays well" with other plugins.  So many people may not want to bother with it at this point.  If you have some interest but not enough to tinker at this point, check back in a month or two to see if things have changed, say around January 2011.

Most recent version (0.12) has many changes to make installation easier and explain it better, see comments in the sample vimrc and sample colorscheme (org_dark.vim).  Thanks especially to ZyX and Marko Mahniƒç  for suggestions on making the plugin cooperate with other plugins in Vim's plugin scheme,  to Chelsea Dijkstra for suggestions on how to improve colorscheme for terminal users, and Stephen Sugden for suggestions on how to streamline settings in the vimrc file

There are also a bunch of videos illustrating some of the
functionality here:

For those who don't know what Org-mode is you can read about it at the
Org-mode site:
http://orgmode.org/

It's hard to describe exactly what Org-mode is and what it can do.
Some people think it's just an outliner with some task management capability.  And it is
that.  But it can do much more, with uses mostly limited by your imagination.  E.g, it can
be used as a high quality document authoring system that exports nicely formatted docs to LaTeX/
PDF.  Or it can be used as a literate programming environment.  The Emacs
Org-mode  feature set is broad and deep; I think there are few people who even
know everything it can do, much less who use a large percentage of its features.  It's
very usable and many people use it just as a simple and easy-to-use outliner.  But if you want to go beyond
that the features are there to use.

I've got a good start on implementing a lot of the major features and
people who are the "early adopter" type may be interested in giving it a spin
right now.  I'd be happy to hear feedback.
